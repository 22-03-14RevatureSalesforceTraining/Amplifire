# Project 1 - Amplifire Acoustics

## Project Description

This project was done in a Trailhead Playground Org. It was focused on administration so there is no code to show.

For my business, I decided to go with a band which tours and sells their merch online and at shows.
The band networks with other groups through leads and opportunities. Bands we've played with before are the accounts.
The idea is that the products are the merch and tickets, and are sold to individuals online and at shows, with different pricebooks for those two.

## Technologies Used

* Salesforce

## Features

List of features ready:
* Lead and case assignment rules set up
* Web-to-lead and web-to-case set up
* Case escalation rules set up
* Opportunity path and case paths are customized
* Security is enforced on all levels - Org level on two profiles, Object level for three user types,
                                       Record level (org wide, role hierarchy, sharing rules, manual sharing), Field level
* Custom app and home page
* Four flows - Screen flow, Before-save, After-save and Autolaunched
* A process through process builder launches the autolaunched flow
* Both standard and custom reports and dashboards


To-do list:
* A future iteration might add some custom objects to deal with band networking instead of using the standard objects in an abnormal way.
* Reports could be more fleshed out
* Home page could use more customization to make it look better
