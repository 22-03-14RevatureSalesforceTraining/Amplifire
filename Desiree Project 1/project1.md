# Project 1 - Desiree Morris

## Business Description

Desi Quinn Creative is a Web Design agency that needs to track sales and marketing processes
and customer service processes. They have many services and products to sell that helps businesses
with their own marketing, branding, and workflow automation needs. They want to use Salesforce to
stream line their processes.

After speaking with the department heads the admin discovered the following: 

The employees working for the **marketing and sales department** will work on **campaigns** in order to find **leads** and turn them into **customer accounts**.  The employees in this department will have scheduled **sales calls** with leads and send **proposals** to these leads.

In order to turn a **lead** into a **customer account,** the lead must **accept a proposal**, **sign a contract**, and **pay their invoice**. 

**Proposals** are created from **products** found in the **price book.  Contracts** are strongly linked to a proposal and a **project** any changes to a **project** requires a new **proposal** and **contract**. **Invoices** are also strongly linked to a **proposal** and **project**, and any changes to a project will require a new **proposal** and **contract**.

**customer accounts** are then assigned to employees on the **design and development team** in order to complete **projects** for those accounts.  

While work is being completed or after work has been completed **customer accounts** can submit problems or questions via **email, phone, social media, slack, and the company website**.  Once they submit their problem it becomes a **case.** These **cases** are then assigned to employees on the **design and development team** as open tickets. Once a case is handled the ticket will be closed.
